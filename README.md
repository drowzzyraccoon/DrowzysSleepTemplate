Thank you for wanting to use this template!

DISCLAIMER:

This code was merged from two templates and heavily adjusted with AI, Gemini.
I do not condone AI but for the purpose of learning it and putting it together,
this is what we had to do for the time being.

AI is approved when it comes to creating code 
as stated within MyOshi's CSS Guide 'Get Started' Bulletin.

_____________________________________________________

Here's some things that you need to know.

The template should be easy to follow and if not, I can see if I can rework it 
to make sure you are able to read it properly and understand it easily.

The template only works well in the 3 light modes being;

1. Kawaii Pink
2. Ocean Blue
3. Classic MyOshi

If you are wanting it to look good in dark mode, 
you will need to have a dark color scheme to compliment it.
Unfortunately there is no way around it at this point in time.
As the site grows, codes will change and they will become more compatible and so on.

There will be updates to this code, especially if there are issues in which it will help ME learn to code and my partner as well.

I plan to try and import a widget into the template to show
what you are currently listening to rather than just one song.

(This will take a while as this is a side project and 
I'm not going to school for coding but rather Video Game Production: Art.)

Again, thank you very much for using this CSS if you choose to do so!

HOW TO USE:


🦝 How to Customize the Ombre Glass Template
Welcome! This template is designed to be super easy to personalize. You don't need to be a coding expert to make it look completely unique.

Almost everything you need to change is located at the very top of the code under 1) CUSTOMIZE VARIABLES HERE.

Here is your cheat sheet for customizing the theme:

🎨 1. Changing the Colors (The Ombre Effect)
Find the /* ---- A) THEME COLORS ---- */ section.

--COLOR-1, --COLOR-2, and --COLOR-3: These three variables control the animated gradient strip at the top of your panels.

How to pick colors: Colors are written in rgba(red, green, blue, transparency) format. You can find RGB color codes by Googling "color picker".

Transparency: The last number (like .70) is how see-through the color is. 1 is solid, and 0 is invisible.

🥛 2. Adjusting the "Glass" Look
Want your panels to look more transparent or heavily frosted?

Milkiness: Look at the --CREAM-TOP and --CREAM-BOTTOM variables. Lowering the very last number in those brackets makes the glass more see-through.

Blur: Find the --BLUR variable. Change 10px to a higher number (like 20px) for a super frosted background, or lower it to 0px if you don't want the background to blur at all.

🫧 3. Changing the Corner Roundness
If you prefer sharp, sleek corners over bubbly ones, look at the /* ---- B) ROUNDNESS + SPACING ---- */ section.

Change --R-LG (Large boxes), --R-MD (Buttons/Inputs), and --R-SM (Small elements).

Change the numbers to 0px for perfectly square boxes, or make the numbers bigger (like 30px) for pillowy, super-rounded edges.

🌟 4. Controlling the Glow
Look under /* ---- C) GLOW CONTROL ---- */:

Turn it off: Change --GLOW-ON from 1 to 0.

Make it stronger: Increase --GLOW-STRENGTH (e.g., to 40px) to make the panels radiate a wider halo of light.

🔴 5. Customizing the Deep Colored Shadows
By default, this theme has a cool red and pink floating shadow behind the main panels. To change these colors, you will need to scroll down just a little bit to Section 4) CARDS (Glass Panels).

Look for the box-shadow: property inside that section.

You will see two colors: rgba(255, 0, 0, .30) (Red) and rgba(255, 0, 120, 0.35) (Pink).

Just swap out the first three numbers of each rgba code to change the shadow to blue, green, purple, or whatever fits your vibe! (Note: Make sure the last number, the transparency, starts with a decimal, like .30!)

✍️ 6. Changing the Font
Back at the bottom of Section 1, you will see a font-family: list.

The browser will try to use the first font on the list ('Quicksand'). If the user doesn't have it, it moves to the next one ('Nunito'), and so on.

You can replace these with any Google Font you like! Just type the name of the font in quotes.
