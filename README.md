Thank you for wanting to use this template!

DISCLAIMER:

This code was merged from two templates and heavily adjusted with AI, Gemini.
I do not condone AI but for the purpose of learning it and putting it together,
this is what we had to do for the time being.

AI is approved when it comes to creating code 
as stated within MyOshi's CSS Guide 'Get Started' Bulletin.

_____________________________________________________

Here's some things that you need to know.

The template should be easy to follow and if not, I can see if I can rework it 
to make sure you are able to read it properly and understand it easily.

The template only works well in the 3 light modes being;

1. Kawaii Pink
2. Ocean Blue
3. Classic MyOshi

If you are wanting it to look good in dark mode, 
you will need to have a dark color scheme to compliment it.
Unfortunately there is no way around it at this point in time.
As the site grows, codes will change and they will become more compatible and so on.

There will be updates to this code, especially if there are issues in which it will help ME learn to code and my partner as well.

I plan to try and import a widget into the template to show
what you are currently listening to rather than just one song.

(This will take a while as this is a side project and 
I'm not going to school for coding but rather Video Game Production: Art.)

Again, thank you very much for using this CSS if you choose to do so!

Special Thanks
