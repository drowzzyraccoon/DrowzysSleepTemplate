Thank you for wanting to use this template!

DISCLAIMER:

This code was merged from two templates and heavily adjusted with AI, Gemini.
I do not condone AI but for the purpose of learning it and putting it together,
this is what we had to do for the time being.

AI is approved when it comes to creating code 
as stated within MyOshi's CSS Guide 'Get Started' Bulletin.

_____________________________________________________

Here's some things that you need to know.

The template should be easy to follow and if not, I can see if I can rework it 
to make sure you are able to read it properly and understand it easily.

The template only works well in the 3 light modes being;

1. Kawaii Pink
2. Ocean Blue
3. Classic MyOshi

If you are wanting it to look good in dark mode, 
you will need to have a dark color scheme to compliment it.
Unfortunately there is no way around it at this point in time.
As the site grows, codes will change and they will become more compatible and so on.

There will be updates to this code, especially if there are issues in which it will help ME learn to code and my partner as well.

I plan to try and import a widget into the template to show
what you are currently listening to rather than just one song.

(This will take a while as this is a side project and 
I'm not going to school for coding but rather Video Game Production: Art.)

Again, thank you very much for using this CSS if you choose to do so!

HOW TO USE:


🦝 How to Customize the Drowzy Ombre Template
Welcome to the Ombre Glass template! This theme is designed to be super easy to customize, even if you don't know much about coding.

You do not need to scroll through hundreds of lines of code to change how this looks. Everything you need is right at the very top of the CSS file in Section 1: The Control Panel.

Here is a quick guide on how to tweak the theme to match your style:

1. Changing the Colors
Find the /* ---- A) THEME COLORS ---- */ section.

--COLOR-1, 2, and 3: These control the moving ombre gradient at the top of your panels.

Colors are written in rgba(red, green, blue, transparency) format. To find new RGB codes, you can just search "Color Picker" on Google! The last number (like 0.70) is the transparency. 1 is solid, and 0 is completely invisible.

2. Adjusting the "Glass" Look
Want your panels to look more transparent or more frosted?

Change the --CREAM-TOP and --CREAM-BOTTOM variables. Lowering the last number in the brackets makes the glass more see-through.

Find the --BLUR variable. Change 10px to a higher number (like 20px) for a super frosted look, or lower it to 0px if you don't want any background blur at all.

3. Controlling the Neon Glow & Shadows
Under /* ---- C) GLOW & HOVER EFFECTS ---- */:

Turn it off: If you don't like the glowing effect, change --GLOW-ON from 1 to 0.

Make it stronger: Increase --GLOW-STRENGTH (e.g., to 40px) to make the panels radiate more light.

Change the shadow colors: Under Section D, update --SHADOW-COLOR-1 and --SHADOW-COLOR-2 to change the color of the deep shadows floating behind your panels.

4. Changing the Roundness
If you prefer sharp corners over bubbly ones, look at /* ---- B) ROUNDNESS + SPACING ---- */. Change --R-LG (Large), --R-MD (Medium), and --R-SM (Small) to 0px for perfectly square boxes, or make the numbers bigger for pillowy, rounded edges.
